# Spiking Neural Network

This is the documentation for how to use our spiking neural network (SNN) frameworks with K-Radar dataset. We tested the SNN frameworks on the following environment:

* Python 3.8.13 (3.10+ does not support open3d.)
* Ubuntu 18.04/20.04
* Torch 1.11.0+cu113
* CUDA 11.3
* opencv 4.2.0.32
* open3d 0.15.2

Currently writing the guidelines, and we will upload them after completion.
