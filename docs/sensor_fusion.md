This is the documentation for how to use our sensor fusion frameworks with K-Radar dataset. We tested the sensor fusion frameworks on the following environment:

* Python 3.8.13
* Ubuntu 20.04
* CUDA 11.3
* Numpy 1.24.4
* Torch 1.12.1+cu113

All code, logs, and guidelines will be made public after review.

Thank you for your understanding.
