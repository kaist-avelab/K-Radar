# Radar Synthesis

This is the documentation for how to use our synthesis frameworks with K-Radar dataset. We tested the synthesis frameworks on the following environment:

* Python 3.8.13 (3.10+ does not support open3d.)
* Ubuntu 18.04/20.04
* Torch 1.11.0+cu113
* CUDA 11.3

All code, logs, and guidelines will be made public after review.

Thank you for your understanding.
