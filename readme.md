`KAIST-Radar (K-Radar)` (provided by ['AVELab'](http://ave.kaist.ac.kr/)) is a novel large-scale object detection dataset and benchmark that contains 35K frames of 4D Radar tensor (4DRT) data with power measurements along the Doppler, range, azimuth, and elevation dimensions, together with carefully annotated 3D bounding box labels of objects on the roads. K-Radar includes challenging driving conditions such as adverse weathers (fog, rain, and snow) on various road structures (urban, suburban roads, alleyways, and highways). In addition to the 4DRT, we provide auxiliary measurements from carefully calibrated high-resolution Lidars, surround stereo cameras, and RTK-GPS. This repository provides the `K-Radar` dataset, annotation tool for 3d bounding boxes, and the visualization tool for showing the inference results and calibrating the sensors.

# K-Radar Dataset
This is the documentation for how to use our detection frameworks with K-Radar dataset.
We tested the K-Radar detection frameworks on the following environment:
* Python 3.8.13 (3.10+ does not support open3d.)
* Ubuntu 18.04/20.04
* Torch 1.11.0+cu113
* CUDA 11.3
* opencv 4.2.0.32
* open3d 0.15.2

## Notice
[2022-10-14] We have realized that the network-attached storage (NAS) download link is unstable. As such, we are preparing the Google Drive download link similar to our other project <a href="https://github.com/kaist-avelab/K-Lane">K-Lane</a>.

[2022-09-30] The `K-Radar` dataset is made available via a network-attached storage (NAS) <a href="http://QuickConnect.to/kaistavelab">download link</a>.

[2022-12-01] The `K-Radar` dataset is being uploaded to Google Drive. It will take time to upload our entire dataset.

[2022-12-06] We are checking and fixing the NAS server after realizing it has been down.

[2022-12-16] We have an unidentified problem in allocating IP to our NAS server. We apologize for this inconvenience.

[2022-12-19] The NAS server's URL has changed and is now accessible.

[2023-01-16] The pipepline for `K-Radar` dataset is updated, and the previous repository has been depracated.

## Preparing the Dataset

* Via our server

1. To download the dataset, log in to <a href="http://QuickConnect.to/kaistavelab"> our server </a> with the following credentials: 
      ID       : kradards
      Password : Kradar2022
2. Go to the "File Station" folder, and download the dataset by right-click --> download.
   Note for Ubuntu user, there might be some error when unzipping the files. Please check the "readme_to_unzip_file_in_linux_system.txt".
3. After all files are downloaded, please arrange the workspace directory with the following structure:
```
KRadarFrameworks
      ├── tools
      ├── configs
      ├── datasets
      ├── models
      ├── pipelines
      ├── resources

            ├── 38
            ...
            ├── 58
```

* Via Google Drive Urls

The `K-Radar` dataset is being uploaded to Google Drive. It will take time to upload our entire dataset.
The 4D Radar tensor is only available on our server because it is too large to upload to Google Drive. (We can charge for up to 2TB of Google Drive storage space.)
We provide camera images, Lidar point cloud, RTK-GPS, and Radar tensor (for network input) via Google Drive for flexibility.
